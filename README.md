# Frontend Mentor - Developer Portfolio Card Solution

This is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View a clean and responsive developer portfolio card component.
- Understand the layout’s structure, including profile details and social media links.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project reinforced my understanding of creating visually balanced components and organizing content effectively using CSS. Below is an example of the CSS code used for aligning buttons:

```css
.button {
  display: block;
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px 0;
  margin: 8px 0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: bold;
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: #444;
}
```

This code demonstrates how to ensure a clean and interactive design for call-to-action elements.

### Continued development

In future projects, I’d like to:

- Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Incorporate accessibility best practices, such as ARIA roles and improved color contrast.
- Add animations to enhance interactivity and visual engagement.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This resource was instrumental in aligning the content and creating a clean structure.
- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) - Helped in creating smooth hover effects for buttons.
